# Ember Wormhole [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yapplabs/ember-wormhole.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yapplabs/ember-wormhole) [![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-wormhole.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-wormhole)

This ember-cli addon provides a component that allows for rendering a block 
to a DOM element somewhere else on the page. The component retains typical Ember 
context in terms of bound data and action handling.

## Live Demo

View a live demo here: [http://yapplabs.github.io/ember-wormhole/](http://yapplabs.github.io/ember-wormhole/)

## But Why?

This library is particularly useful for cases where you have UI that is the logical child of
a component but needs to render as a top-level DOM element, such as a confirmation dialog.

## And How?

This component tracks its element's child nodes. When inserted into the DOM, it appends 
its child nodes to a destination element elsewhere. When removed from the DOM, it
removes its child nodes, so as not to orphan them on the other side of the wormhole. 

Nothing else changes -- data binding  and action bubbling still flow according to 
the Ember component hierarchy. That includes usages of `yield`, so blocks provided 
to `ember-wormhole` simply appear in another part of the DOM.

## Show Me Some Code!

We thought you'd never ask...

Given the following DOM:

```html
<body class="ember-application">
  <!-- Destination must be in the same element as your ember app -->
  <!-- otherwise events/bindings will not work -->
  <div id="destination">
  </div>
  <div class="ember-view">
    <!-- rest of your Ember app's DOM... -->
  </div>
</body>
```

and a template like this:

```hbs
{{#ember-wormhole to="destination"}}
  Hello world!
{{/ember-wormhole}}
```

Then "Hello world!" would be rendered inside the `destination` div.

If the ember-wormhole is destroyed its far-off children are destroyed too.
For example, given:

```hbs
{{#if isWormholeEnabled}}
  {{#ember-wormhole to="destination"}}
    Hello world!
  {{/ember-wormhole}}
{{/if}}
```

If `isWormholeEnabled` starts off true and becomes false, then the "Hello
world!" text will be removed from the `destination` div.

Similarly, if you use `ember-wormhole` in a route's template, it will
render its children in the destination element when the route is entered
and remove them when the route is exited.

If you wish to render into an element that's not an id, you may do something likt his

```hbs
{{#if isWormholeEnabled}}
  {{#ember-wormhole destinationElementSelector="#ember1337 .component-body"}}
    Hello world!
  {{/ember-wormhole}}
{{/if}}
```

## Can I Render In Place (i.e. Unwormhole)?

Yes! Sometimes you feel like a wormhole. Sometimes you don't. Situations 
sometimes call for the same content to be rendered through the wormhole or in place.

In this example, `renderInPlace` will override `to` and cause the wormhole content to be rendered in place.

```hbs
{{#ember-wormhole to="destination" renderInPlace="true"}}
  Hello world!
{{/ember-wormhole}}
```

This technique is useful for:

- Presenting typically-wormholed content within a styleguide
- Toggling content back and forth through the wormhole
- Parlor tricks

## And what about selectors?

Selectors that return more than one result will throw an error. For example, if we have

```html
...
<div class="actor jason-spader"></div>
<div class="actor kurt-russel"></div>
```

Then this would be fine

```hbs
{{#ember-wormhole destinationElementSelector=".jason-spader"}}
 ...
{{/ember-wormhole}}
```
but this would not

```hbs
{{#ember-wormhole destinationElementSelector=".actor"}}
 ...
{{/ember-wormhole}}
```
